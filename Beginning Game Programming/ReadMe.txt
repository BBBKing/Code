Beginning Game Programming - Examples
======================================================
Microsoft Visual Studio/C++ .NET 2002 (v7.0)


INTRO
===============
Microsoft Visual Studio/C++ 2002 (v7.0) is a graphical suite of development tools that allow you to build Windows applications. Visual Studio solution files are included for each example program and game in the book, and are named Example.sln, where Example is the name of the example. You'll need to open a .sln file in Visual Studio to open and build any of the examples.

TESTING
===============
To test the examples, just go to the Debug folder within the appropriate example folder and double-click the .exe file for the example. The examples are already built, so you don't have to build them in order to test them. Have fun!
