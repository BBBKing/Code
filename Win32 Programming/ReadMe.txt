Welcome to the Win32 Programming CD-ROM.  This disk contains the complete
source files for the book, as well as debug and release executables.  Some of
the applications are compiled for Unicode, and have Unicode release and
Unicode debug versions.

Only the release version executable icons are added to the Win32 Programming
folder and the task bar.

Watch our Web site for updated executables, new executables, and updated help
files.

You can use the Options... button during the install to select whether you
want the full install, or only the executables.  Since the source files are
stored on the CD-ROM in uncompressed format, you can look at them any time
without having to install them on your hard drive.

All projects on this CDROM have been built in the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2
environment.  Some of them depend upon bug fixes that were introduced with
VC++ 4.2 or MFC 4.2 and may not operate correctly when compiled with earlier
versions of the environment.
